OSX PDF Toolkit
=======
Because some tools such as PDFTk no longer work on OSX El Capitan we thought we might share a few tools which are helpful under OSX. 
Please feel free to submit new tools. Try to make them python compatible and avoid using third party libraries if possible.

This utility will burst your PDF into separate files. Usage:

```

cat
